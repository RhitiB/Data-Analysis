# Spotify Audio Features EDA ðŸŽ§

This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **statistical hypothesis testing** on a dataset of Spotify tracks to uncover patterns in musical attributes like energy, danceability, acousticness, and speechiness.
---
## Objective

To explore audio features of Apotify tracks and analyze how attributes like "speechiness", "energy", and `mode` vary across different types of music. The goal is to gain statistical insight into how musical characteristics differ, especially in genres like rap vs regular pop tracks.
